## Project Overview
The goal is to create a scalable microservices-based e-commerce application using Go and Kubernetes. This system will consist of several independent microservices that handle different aspects of the e-commerce business, such as user management, product inventory, and order processing.

## 1. Microservices Breakdown
- **User Management Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Product Inventory Service**: Manages product listings, stock levels, and pricing.
- **Order Processing Service**: Takes care of order placement, payment processing (integrating with a mock payment gateway), and order status updates.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Go**: All microservices will be written in Go, leveraging its strong support for concurrent operations and performance.
- **Docker**: Each microservice will be containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and scalability in Kubernetes.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates and manages the containerized services, handling deployment, scaling, and management of the microservice containers.
- **Prometheus**: Integrated into Kubernetes for monitoring the state and performance of the microservices.
- **Grafana**: Connects to Prometheus to provide visual analytics and dashboards for monitoring the microservices.

## 3. Microservices Communication
- **RESTful APIs**: Services will communicate with each other over HTTP/HTTPS using RESTful APIs.
- **gRPC**: For internal communications that require higher efficiency and lower latency, gRPC can be used.

## 4. Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each service will have its own dedicated database to ensure loose coupling and data encapsulation.
- **Persistent Volume in Kubernetes**: For database storage, Kubernetes persistent volumes will be used to ensure data persistence across pod restarts.

## 5. Monitoring Setup
- **Prometheus**: Deployed as a part of the Kubernetes cluster to collect metrics from each microservice. Metrics to monitor could include request count, error rates, response times, and system resource usage.
- **Grafana**: Used to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. Set up dashboards specific to each microservice and general dashboards for overall health.
