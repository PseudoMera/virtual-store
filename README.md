## Project Overview
The goal is to create a scalable microservices-based e-commerce application using Go and Kubernetes. This system will consist of several independent microservices that handle different aspects of the e-commerce business, such as user management, product inventory, and order processing.

## 1. Microservices Breakdown
- **User Management Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Product Inventory Service**: Manages product listings, stock levels, and pricing.
- **Order Processing Service**: Takes care of order placement, payment processing (integrating with a mock payment gateway), and order status updates.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Go**: All microservices will be written in Go, leveraging its strong support for concurrent operations and performance.
- **Docker**: Each microservice will be containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and scalability in Kubernetes.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates and manages the containerized services, handling deployment, scaling, and management of the microservice containers.
- **Prometheus**: Integrated into Kubernetes for monitoring the state and performance of the microservices.
- **Grafana**: Connects to Prometheus to provide visual analytics and dashboards for monitoring the microservices.

## 3. Microservices Communication
- **RESTful APIs**: Services will communicate with each other over HTTP/HTTPS using RESTful APIs.
- **gRPC (optional)**: For internal communications that require higher efficiency and lower latency, gRPC can be used, which is well-supported by Go.

## 4. Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each service will have its own dedicated database to ensure loose coupling and data encapsulation. You might choose a different type of database based on the service requirements (e.g., PostgreSQL for order data, MongoDB for user data).
- **Persistent Volume in Kubernetes**: For database storage, Kubernetes persistent volumes will be used to ensure data persistence across pod restarts.

## 5. Monitoring Setup
- **Prometheus**: Deployed as a part of the Kubernetes cluster to collect metrics from each microservice. Metrics to monitor could include request count, error rates, response times, and system resource usage.
- **Grafana**: Used to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. Set up dashboards specific to each microservice and general dashboards for overall health.

## 6. Development and Deployment
- **Local Development**: Use tools like Minikube or Docker Desktop to simulate a Kubernetes environment locally.
- **CI/CD**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment of your microservices to Kubernetes. This includes steps for building Docker images, running tests, and deploying to Kubernetes.
- **Configuration Management**: Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data for your services.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Service Authentication**: Implement service-to-service authentication using mutual TLS or OAuth tokens.
- **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate services, providing an additional layer of security (like rate limiting and IP whitelisting).

## Deliverables
- **Source Code**: Complete source code for all services, written in Go.
- **Dockerfiles**: For building the containers of each microservice.
- **Kubernetes YAML Files**: For defining deployments, services, volumes, and other Kubernetes resources.
- **Monitoring Dashboards**: Custom Grafana dashboards tailored to the needs of monitoring your application.
